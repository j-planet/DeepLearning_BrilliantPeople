Geldof was born and brought up in DÃºn Laoghaire, Ireland, a son of Robert and Evelyn Geldof. His paternal grandfather, Zenon Geldof, was a Belgian immigrant and a hotel chef. His paternal grandmother, Amelia Falk, was an English Jew from London. When Geldof was six or seven, his mother, Evelyn, 41, died of a cerebral haemorrhage.
Bob Geldof attended Blackrock College, where he was bullied for being a poor rugby player and for his middle name, Zenon.
