Family
His family is Jewish. Abramovich's family is from Tauragė, Lithuania, Lithuanian spelling of the family name being Abramavičius (pronounced Ab-ra-ma-vee-choos). His father Arkady (Aron) Abramovich (1937–1970), was a state office manager, while his grandfather Nahim (Nahman) Abramovich (1887–1942), was a businessman. Abramovich's mother is Irina Michalenko, his maternal grandfather was Vassili Michalenko and his maternal grandmother was Faina Grutman. Abramovich is a chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia (which is allied with Putin's administration), and donates money to the Chabad movement. Abramovich has been married three times.
In December 1987, he married Olga Yurevna Lysova; they divorced in 1990. In October 1991, he married a former Russian Aeroflot stewardess, Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina. They divorced in 2007. He and Malandina have five children; Ilya, Arina, Sofia, Arkadiy and Anna. On 15 October 2006, the News of the World reported that Irina had hired two top UK divorce lawyers, following reports of Abramovich's close relationship with the then 25-year-old Dasha Zhukova, the former girlfriend of the tennis player Marat Safin and daughter of a prominent Russian oligarch, Alexander Radkin Zhukov. It was speculated that a future divorce settlement (amounting to a conjectured £5.5 billion (€6.5 billion)) might be the highest ever on record. The Abramoviches replied that neither had consulted attorneys at that point. However, they later divorced in Russia in March 2007, with a settlement reported as being US$300 million (€213 million). Abramovich married Zhukova in a secret ceremony in 2008, and they have two children, a son, Aaron Alexander, and a daughter, Leah Lou.

According to Forbes, as of March 2016, Abramovich had a net worth of US$7.6 billion, ranking him as the 151th richest person in the world.

Early in 2009, The Times estimated that due to the global economic crisis he had lost £3 billion from his £11.7 billion wealth.

Abramovich reportedly donated more money to charity than any other living Russian. Between 2009 and 2013, Abramovich donated more than US$2.5 billion to build schools, hospitals and infrastructure in Chukotka. In addition, Evraz Plc (EVR), the steelmaker partly owned by Abramovich, donated US$164 million for social projects between 2010 through 2012, an amount that is excluded in Abramovich’s US$310 million donations during this period.
