Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. He was called Stephe (pronounced "Stevie") by his family, He was named after his godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer; his third name was his mother's maiden name. After Baden-Powell's father died in 1860, to identify her children with her late husband's fame and set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins, his mother styled the family name Baden-Powell (the name was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.)
Baden-Powell was the son of The Reverend Baden Powell, a Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University and Church of England priest and his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824 – 13 October 1914), eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth.
Baden-Powell had four much older half-siblings from the second of his father's two previous marriages and full siblings Warington (1847-1921), George (1847-98), the often ill Augustus (1849–63) and Francis (1850-1933), three others who had died very young before Baden-Powell was born, Agnes (1858-1945) and Baden (1860-1937).
Baden-Powell's father died when Baden-Powell was three. Subsequently, Baden-Powell was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. Baden-Powell would say of her in 1933 "The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother."
Baden-Powell attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells. He was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school. He played the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds.
