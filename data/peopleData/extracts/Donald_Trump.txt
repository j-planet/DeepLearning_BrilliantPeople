<p><b>Donald John Trump</b> (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, television personality, politician, and the 45th President of the United States.</p>
<p>He was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City where he lived until enrolling at age 13 in the New York Military Academy. Trump earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971, he took charge of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump built, renovated, and managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He has lent the use of his name in the branding of various products. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he hosted <i>The Apprentice</i>, a reality television series on NBC, from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes</i> listed him as the 324th wealthiest person in the world, and 113th in the United States, with a net worth of $4.5<span> </span>billion.</p>
<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's 2000 presidential nomination, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election, and quickly emerged as the front-runner among 17 candidates in the Republican primaries. His final opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention along with Mike Pence as his running mate. His campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false.</p>
<p>Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth elected with less than a plurality of the national popular vote.</p>
<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. He advocates a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, "extreme vetting" of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to preempt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIS. His positions have been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist, and nationalist.</p>

<h3><span id="Early_life">Early life</span></h3>

<p>Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Christ "Fred" Trump (1905–1999) and Mary Anne Trump (née MacLeod, 1912–2000). His siblings are Maryanne, Fred Jr., Elizabeth, and Robert. Trump's older brother Fred Jr. died in 1981 from alcoholism, which Trump says led him to abstain from alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
<h3><span id="Ancestry">Ancestry</span></h3>
<p>Trump is of paternal German ancestry and maternal Scottish ancestry. His mother and grandparents were born in Europe.</p>
<p>His paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, originally emigrated to the United States in 1885, became a citizen in 1892, and amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and Klondike, Canada. After marrying in 1902, the family moved back to Kallstadt but were ordered to leave because Friedrich did not complete the mandatory military service and did not register his initial emigration to the United States.</p>
<p>His father was born in the Bronx, and became a New York City real estate developer. His mother emigrated from her birthplace of Tong, Lewis, Scotland to New York, where she worked as a maid. Fred and Mary met in New York and married in 1936, raising their family in Queens.</p>
<p>His uncle John G. Trump—a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973—was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and helped design X-ray machines that prolonged the lives of cancer patients. in January 1943, physicist Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, and the FBI requested John Trump to examine Tesla's papers and equipment.</p>
<p>The Trump family were originally Lutherans, but Trump's parents belonged to the Reformed Church in America. The family name, which was formerly spelled <i>Drumpf</i>, was changed to <i>Trump</i> during the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century. Trump has said that he is proud of his German heritage; he served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.</p>
<h3><span id="Education">Education</span></h3>

<p>Trump attended the Kew-Forest School. At 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy (NYMA), in Cornwall, New York, where he finished eighth grade and high school.</p>
<p>Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years, beginning in August 1964. He then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, which offered one of the few real estate studies departments in United States academia at the time. While there, he worked at the family's company, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, named for his paternal grandmother. He graduated from Penn in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.</p>
<p>Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War. While in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments. In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board, but was given a 1-Y medical deferment in October 1968. He has attributed his medical deferment to heel spurs. In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which would also have likely exempted him from service.</p>
<h3><span id="Family">Family</span></h3>


<p>Trump has five children by three marriages, and has eight grandchildren. His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.</p>
<p>Trump married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, on April 7, 1977 at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale. They had three children: son Donald Jr. (born December 31, 1977), daughter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981), and son Eric (born January 6, 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988. The couple divorced in 1990 following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.</p>
<p>In October 1993, Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany, named after Tiffany &amp; Company. They married two months later on December 20, 1993. The couple divorced in June 1999.</p>

<p>Trump married Slovene model Melania Knauss, on January 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church on the island of Palm Beach, Florida; a reception followed at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In 2006, Melania became a naturalized United States citizen. She gave birth to their son Barron on March 20, 2006. Barron is fluent in Slovene and English.</p>
<h3><span id="Religious_views">Religious views</span></h3>
<p>Trump identifies as Presbyterian. As a child, he began going to church at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. He attended Sunday school and had his confirmation at that church. Trump said in 2015 that he attends Reformed Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977, and the church says he is not an "active member". He is also loosely affiliated with Lakeside Presbyterian Church in West Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago estate. In December 2016, Trump visited Bethesda-by-the-Sea, an Episcopal church, for Christmas services.</p>
<p>Trump has said that he participates in Holy Communion. Beyond that, he has not asked God for forgiveness, stating: "I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture."</p>
<p>Trump refers to his ghostwritten book <i>The Art of the Deal</i> as "my second favorite book of all time, after the Bible. Nothing beats the Bible". In a speech to Liberty University, he referred to Second Corinthians as "Two Corinthians", eliciting chuckles from the audience. Despite this, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought "that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure".</p>
<p>Outside of his church affiliations, Trump has relationships with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been described as his "closest spiritual confidant." In 2015, he asked for and received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson and, in 2016, released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.</p>
<p>Referring to his daughter Ivanka's conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said in 2015: "I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that […] it wasn't in the plan but I am very glad it happened."</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>A 2016 medical report by his doctor, Harold Bornstein M.D., showed that Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid function were in normal ranges. Trump says that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed other drugs, including marijuana. He also does not drink alcohol, a decision stemming from his brother's death from alcoholism.</p>
<h3><span id="Net_worth">Net worth</span></h3>
<p>Trump was listed on the initial <i>Forbes List</i> of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having an estimated $200<span> </span>million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200<span> </span>million net worth. He was absent from the list from 1990 to 1995 following losses which reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993. Trump told campaign audiences he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, which he paid back with interest.</p>

<p>On June 16, 2015, when announcing his candidacy, Trump released a one-page financial summary stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. "I'm really rich", he said. <i>Forbes</i> believed his suggestion of $9<span> </span>billion was "a whopper", figuring it was actually $4.1 billion. The summary statement includes $3.3 billion worth of "real estate licensing deals, brand and branded developments", putting a figure on Trump's estimate of his own brand value. The July 2015 FEC disclosure reports assets worth above $1.4 billion and debts above $265<span> </span>million. According to <i>Bloomberg</i>, Trump "only reported revenue for [his] golf properties in his campaign filings even though the disclosure form asks for income", whereas independent filings showed his European golf properties to be unprofitable. Trump has stated that his income for the year 2014 was $362<span> </span>million.</p>
<p>After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania, which <i>Forbes</i> estimated negatively impacted his net worth by $125<span> </span>million. The value of the Trump brand may have fallen further during his presidential campaign, as some consumers boycotted Trump-branded products and services to protest his candidacy. Bookings and foot traffic at Trump-branded properties fell off sharply in 2016, and the release of the <i>Access Hollywood</i> tape recordings in October 2016 exacerbated this.</p>
<p>In their 2016 annual billionaires' rankings, <i>Forbes</i> estimated Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion (113th in the United States, 324th in the world) and <i>Bloomberg</i> at $3<span> </span>billion, making him one of the richest politicians in American history. Trump himself stated that his net worth was over $10<span> </span>billion, with the discrepancy essentially stemming from the uncertain value of appraised property and of his personal brand.</p>
<h2><span id="Real_estate_career">Real estate career</span></h2>


<p>Prior to graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump began his real estate career at his father's company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. During his undergraduate study, Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, used a $500,000 investment to successfully reopen the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>After being promoted to president of the company in the early 1970s (while his father became chairman of the board), he renamed it to The Trump Organization. In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments, rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. An agreement was later signed in which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League.</p>
<h3><span id="Early_Manhattan_developments">Early Manhattan developments</span></h3>
<p>Trump's first major real estate deal in Manhattan was the remodeling of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The building was remodeled from an older Commodore Hotel, and was largely funded by a $70<span> </span>million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain.</p>
<p>In 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, for which <i>The New York Times</i> attributed his "persistence" and "skills as a negotiator". The building was completed in 1983, and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization. Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show <i>The Apprentice</i>, and includes a fully functional television studio set.</p>

<p>Repairs on the Wollman Rink in Central Park, built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a general contractor unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected <span> </span><span>2<span> </span><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>-year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $750,000 less than the initial budget of $1.95 million, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concession rights.</p>
<p>Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 for $400<span> </span>million, and asked his then-wife Ivana to manage its operation and renovation.</p>
<h3><span id="Palm_Beach_estate">Palm Beach estate</span></h3>

<p>Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1985 for $5<span> </span>million, plus $3<span> </span>million for the home's furnishings. It was built from 1924 to 1927 by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents.</p>
<p>In addition to using the home for this purpose, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with Lee Iacocca that became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.</p>
<h3><span id="Atlantic_City_casinos">Atlantic City casinos</span></h3>
<p>Harrah's at Trump Plaza opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp. and operated by the Harrah's gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino's poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp. Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320<span> </span>million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump's wife, Ivana, managed the property.</p>

<p>Later in 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International. The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1<span> </span>billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built. Financed with $675<span> </span>million in junk bonds at a 14% interest rate, the project entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year. Banks and bondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted to restructure the debt.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50 percent ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt. He also sold his financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the <i>Trump Princess</i>. The property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated into Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8<span> </span>billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50<span> </span>million in assets and $500<span> </span>million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties. Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.</p>
<p>In 2011 after Chris Christie became governor, Trump casinos settled a long-running $30 million tax dispute for 17 cents on the dollar. In 2015, the Taj Mahal's parent company settled for $10 million in a money-laundering lawsuit brought by the U.S. government, admitting only to record-keeping and reporting violations.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition from the Native-American owned Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. In 1993, Trump made controversial comments in his testimony to a Congressional committee, famously stating that the casino owners did not look like real Indians. But despite that well-publicized quote which related to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor who backed the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were seeking state recognition.</p>
<h3><span id="Bankruptcies.2C_taxes.2C_and_other_legal_affairs">Bankruptcies, taxes, and other legal affairs</span></h3>

<p>Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds. Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by <i>Newsweek</i> in 2011 saying, "I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me" as a tool for trimming debt.</p>
<p>The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009). Trump said, "I've used the laws of this country to pare debt ... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on <i>The Apprentice</i>. It's not personal. It's just business."</p>
<p>A 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by <i>The Economist</i> concluded that his "… performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York", noting both his successes and bankruptcies. A subsequent analysis by <i>The Washington Post</i> concluded that "Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success."</p>
<p>Trump claimed a loss of $916<span> </span>million on his 1995 tax returns. As net operating losses from one year can be applied to offset income from future years, this loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income during the eighteen-year carry forward period. Trump acknowledged using the deduction but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied. When questioned during a presidential debate about such practices, he stated that avoiding paying income tax through such methods "makes me smart".</p>
<p><i>The New York Times</i> found that some accountants considered Trump's tax deduction methods in the early 1990s "legally dubious". Independent tax experts stated that "Whatever loophole existed was not 'exploited' here, but stretched beyond any recognition" and that it involved "sleight of hand", further speculating that Trump's casino bankruptcies were probably related to Trump's 1995 reported loss.</p>
<p>An analysis by <i>USA Today</i>, published in June 2016, found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses had been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state courts, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate. Of the 3,500 suits, mostly in the casino industry, Trump or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900; defendant in 1,450; and third party, filer of bankruptcy, or other in 150. Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court.</p>
<h3><span id="More_buildings_in_New_York_and_worldwide">More buildings in New York and worldwide</span></h3>

<p>Trump acquired a vacant seventy-story skyscraper on Wall Street in 1996: the former Bank of Manhattan Trust Building which had briefly been the tallest in the world when completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, it was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions of his father's estate valued at $250–300 million.</p>
<p>In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters. Trump also began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He continued to own commercial space in Trump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle which he acquired in 1996, and also continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.</p>
<p>Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue.</p>
<p>Most recently, The Trump Organization has expanded its footprint beyond the United States, with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, New York City, Washington D.C., Panama City, Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Vancouver.</p>
<h4><span id="Ties_to_Russia">Ties to Russia</span></h4>

<p>Trump has pursued business deals in Russia since 1987, although his real estate projects there never materialized. In 1996, Trump filed trademark applications for potential Russian real estate development deals. Along with his partners and children, Trump visited Moscow several times, connecting with developers and government officials to explore joint venture opportunities. However, some of his real estate developments outside Russia have received a large part of their financing from private Russian investors, sometimes referred to as "oligarchs". In 2008 his son Donald Trump Jr. said "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets" and "we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia". Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, in partnership with Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, but, as of 2017, he has no known investments or businesses in Russia.</p>
<h3><span id="Golf_courses">Golf courses</span></h3>

<p>The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according to <i>Golfweek</i>. Trump's personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382<span> </span>million.</p>
<p>In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of some local residents on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A 2011 independent documentary, <i>You've Been Trumped</i>, by British filmmaker Anthony S. Baxter, chronicled the golf resort's construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Trump. Despite Trump's promises of 6,000 jobs, he stated in 2016 that the golf course has created only 200 jobs. In June 2015, Trump made an appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course, which was dismissed by five justices at the UK Supreme Court in December 2015.</p>
<p>In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship 4 times between 1977 and 2009. After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened on June 24, 2016.</p>
<h2><span id="Business_career_beyond_real_estate">Business career beyond real estate</span></h2>

<p>In 1971, Trump took charge of the family real estate firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, and later renamed it The Trump Organization. He greatly expanded its real estate operations as well as venturing into numerous other business activities. It eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.</p>
<p>When Trump was elected president in November 2016, the question arose how he would avoid conflicts of interest with his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two oldest sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.</p>
<p>Trump retains his financial stake in the business. His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that the Trump Organization would not pursue any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.</p>
<h3><span id="Sports_events">Sports events</span></h3>


<p>In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, an American Football team playing in the United States Football League (USFL), from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the National Football League (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.</p>
<p>After the 1985 season, the Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers, but had continuing financial troubles. The USFL, which was down to just seven active franchises from a high of 18, was soon forced to fold, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.</p>
<p>Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries. He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including Mike Tyson's 1988 fight against Michael Spinks, and at one time, acted as a financial advisor to Tyson.</p>
<p>In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia. The inaugural race was controversial, and Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990, because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.</p>
<p>Trump submitted a stalking-horse bid on the Buffalo Bills when it came up for sale following Ralph Wilson's death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, and Kim and Terrence Pegula won the auction. During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL's updated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made "soft" and "weak", saying a concussion is just "a ding on the head". He accused referees of throwing penalty flags needlessly just to be seen on television "so their wives see them at home."</p>
<h3><span id="Beauty_pageants">Beauty pageants</span></h3>

<p>From 1996 until 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. The Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the California clothing company Pacific Mills. Trump was dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled his pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.</p>
<p>In 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump's controversial 2015 presidential campaign remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants. Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation. The lawsuit was settled in February 2016, but terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC's stake. He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards to WME/IMG.</p>
<h3><span id="Model_Management">Model Management</span></h3>

<p>In 1999, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought nearly 250 foreign fashion models into the United States to work in the fashion industry since 2000. In 2014, the company, along with its president Corrine Nicolas and other managers, were sued by one of the agency's former models, Alexia Palmer, alleging racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud, and violating immigrant wage laws. Palmer alleged that Trump Model Management promised to withhold only 20% of her net pay as agency expenses, but after charging her for "obscure expenses", ended up taking 80%. The case was dismissed from U.S. federal court in March 2016, in part because Palmer's immigration status, via H1-B visa sponsored by Trump, required labor complaints to be filed through a separate process.</p>
<h3><span id="University">University</span></h3>

<p>Trump University LLC was an American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, and offered courses, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course. In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word "university" violated state law, and after a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the "Trump Entrepreneurial Institute". Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.</p>
<p>In 2013 the state of New York filed a $40<span> </span>million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers. In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias because of his Mexican heritage. On June 7, 2016, Trump clarified that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.</p>
<p>The <i>Low v. Trump</i> case was set for trial in San Diego beginning November 28, 2016. Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases. In the settlement, Trump did not admit to any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a total of $25<span> </span>million. The settlement was agreed to just an hour before a hearing regarding Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the inauguration. Jason Forge, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said he "definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach" from the Trump representatives after the election.</p>
<h3><span id="Branding_and_licensing">Branding and licensing</span></h3>

<p>Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies, as well as licensing his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects. In 2011, <i>Forbes</i><span>'</span> financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.</p>
<p>Because developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects, some buildings that display his name are not owned or operated by him. According to <i>Forbes</i>, this portion of Trump's empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562<span> </span>million valuation, with 33 licensing projects under development including seven Trump International Hotel and Tower "condo hotels".</p>
<p>Properties to which Trump has licensed his name and image include two in Florida that have gone into foreclosure. The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.</p>
<p>Trump also licensed his name to son-in-law Jared Kushner's fifty-story Trump Bay Street, a Jersey City luxury development that has raised $50<span> </span>million of its $200<span> </span>million capitalization largely from wealthy Chinese nationals who, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government's expedited EB-5 visa program, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years. Trump is a partner with Kushner Properties only in name licensing and not in the building's financing.</p>
<h3><span id="Foundation">Foundation</span></h3>

<p>The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book <i>Trump: The Art of the Deal</i> by Trump and Tony Schwartz. The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump, who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.</p>
<p>The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups. In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000). From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007. Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>In 2016, investigations by <i>The Washington Post</i> uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York. A Trump spokesman called the investigation a "partisan hit job". In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".</p>
<h2><span id="Media_career">Media career</span></h2>

<p>Trump has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award and has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series. He has also played an oil tycoon in <i>The Little Rascals</i>. Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000. He has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called <i>Trumped!</i></p>
<h3><span id="The_Apprentice"><i>The Apprentice</i></span></h3>


<p>In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show <i>The Apprentice</i>, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively "fired" and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode. In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show, although the network did not verify the statement. In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p>
<p>Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of <i>The Celebrity Apprentice</i>, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and "firing" losers. International versions of <i>The Apprentice</i> franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing <i>The Apprentice</i> for a 15th season. On February 27, Trump stated that he was "not ready" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run. Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production. On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, "Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump."</p>
<p>After Trump's election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season. Trump is still credited as an executive producer for the show.</p>
<h3><span id="Professional_wrestling">Professional wrestling</span></h3>
<p>Trump is a WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) fan, and a friend of WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon. In 1988–89 Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall (dubbed "Trump Plaza" for storyline purposes) and has been an active participant in several of the shows. He also appeared in WrestleMania VII, and was interviewed ringside at WrestleMania XX.</p>
<p>Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called "The Battle of the Billionaires". He was in the corner of Bobby Lashley, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee. The terms of the match were that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost. Lashley won the match, and so McMahon was shaved bald.</p>
<p>On June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on <i>Monday Night Raw</i> that he had "sold" the show to Trump. Appearing on screen, Trump declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show. McMahon "bought back" <i>Raw</i> the following week for twice the price.</p>
<p>Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the following night at WrestleMania 29.</p>
<h2><span id="Political_career_up_to_2015">Political career up to 2015</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Early_involvement_in_politics">Early involvement in politics</span></h3>

<p>Trump considered the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races. In February 2009, Trump appeared on the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that "instead of asking for money", General Motors "should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal".</p>
<p>As Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. A <i>Newsweek</i> poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States. A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run. His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p>
<p>Trump played a leading role in "birther" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as President. Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008, Trump demanded to see the original "long-form" certificate. He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings. He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya. When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate, Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying "I hope it checks out." His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand, and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him "very popular". In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school. When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further. In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party. Christopher R. Barron, co-founder of GOProud, would later endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and launch "LGBT for Trump", a political campaign with the goal of gaining the LGBT community's political support for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates. On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he ran.</p>
<p>In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama's "unprecedented media protection", and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump spent over $1<span> </span>million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States. In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him. In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community. A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election. In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of <i>The Apprentice</i>, as he mulled his political future.</p>
<h3><span id="2000_presidential_campaign">2000 presidential campaign</span></h3>

<p>In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000. A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support. Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still won the party's California and Michigan primaries after doing so.</p>
<h3><span id="Political_affiliations">Political affiliations</span></h3>

<p>Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump's political party affiliations prior to 1987 remain unclear, though Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for United States President in the late 1970s. By 1987, Trump had identified as a Republican.</p>
<p>In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican. In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.</p>
<p>Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans. After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats. In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President. When asked in 2015 which recent president he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.</p>
<p>According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name. Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.</p>
<h2><span id="2016_presidential_campaign">2016 presidential campaign</span></h2>


<p>On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in New York City. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large themes during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again".</p>
<p>In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness, stated that the media has intentionally misinterpreted his words, and made other claims of adverse media bias. In part due to his fame, Trump's run for president received an unprecedented amount of unpaid coverage from the media that elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.</p>
<p>Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him early on. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared he could harm the image of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration. Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists. In August, he appointed Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, described by Bannon as "the platform for the alt-right".</p>
<p>Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on protesters inside the rallies, and clashes between protesters and Trump supporters outside the venues.</p>
<p>Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates. At least four major publications – <i>Politico</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> – have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements. Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth. Trump has called his public speaking "truthful hyperbole", though online media outlets such as Yahoo! believed Trump's "truthful hyperbole" to be a political tactic. Lucas Graves, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, opined, of Trump's speaking, that Trump "often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers "have to be really careful when you pick claims to check to pick things ... that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate". Other sources, such as <i>NPR</i>, also observed that Trump's statements during the campaign were often opaque or suggestive.</p>
<h3><span id="Primaries">Primaries</span></h3>


<p>Trump entered a field of 16 candidates campaigning for the 2016 Republican nomination, the largest presidential field in American history. Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the seventh debate on January 28 (that was the last debate before primary voting began on February 1). The debates received historically high viewership, increasing the visibility of Trump's campaign.</p>
<p>By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote and remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination. After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee. With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party. He also set the record for the largest number of votes against the front runner.</p>
<h3><span id="General_election_campaign">General election campaign</span></h3>



<p>After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to "save [their] vote for the general election". Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old British man illegally residing in the U.S. during one of his rallies in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Clinton had established a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy. Of the matter, FBI Director James Comey opined Clinton had been "extremely careless" in her handling of classified government material.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2016, Trump announced Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate. Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention. The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole but the other prior nominees did not attend, though John McCain endorsed Trump prior to the convention.</p>
<p>Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech. The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35 million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.</p>
<p>In late July, Trump came close to Clinton in national polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the small side by historical standards. Following Clinton's 7 percent convention bounce, she extended her lead over Trump significantly in national polls at the start of August.</p>
<h4><span id="Requests_to_release_tax_returns">Requests to release tax returns</span></h4>

<p>Trump has declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns, which led to speculation about whether or not he was hiding something. Pursuant to FEC regulations, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form that listed all his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.</p>
<p>Trump said that his tax returns are being audited and his lawyers advise against release. Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was "none of your business", but added, "I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible." Every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 released their taxes before the election. Although no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit, tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.</p>
<p>In January 2017, a We the People petition demanding Trump release his tax returns broke the White House record for number of signatures gathered.</p>
<h3><span id="Presidential_debates">Presidential debates</span></h3>

<p>On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Lester Holt, an anchor with NBC News, was the moderator. This was the most watched presidential debate in United States history. The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on October 19. Trump's refusal to say whether or not he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.</p>
<h3><span id="Political_positions">Political positions</span></h3>

<p>Media have described Trump's political positions as "populist", and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation, consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment, usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy. According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a "fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.</p>
<p>Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time. <i>Politico</i> has described his positions as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory", while NBC News counted "141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues" during his campaign.</p>
<h3><span id="Russian_interference_in_election">Russian interference in election</span></h3>

<p>Several of Trump's top advisers, including Paul Manafort and Michael T. Flynn who had official positions before Trump replaced them, have had strong ties to Russia. Ukrainian officials provided evidence that helped to force Manafort's resignation as campaign manager. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin for being a strong leader, but rebuffed claims that he loves Putin, commending Mike Pence's vice-presidential debate performance in which Pence characterized Putin as a "small and bullying leader" who had nevertheless been stronger than the Obama administration. Later, American intelligence sources stated with "high confidence" that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump by hacking into computers of Trumps' opponents, and that members of Trump's campaign were in contact with Russian government officials both before and after the presidential election. For these reasons, there has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump's relationship to Russia.</p>
<p>Trump has said, "I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia." Indeed, as of 2017, Trump has no known investments or businesses in Russia. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed in March 2017 that he still believed Russia intervened in the election to help Trump, but that as of his January 2017 ODNI report, investigations by the FBI, CIA and NSA had uncovered no evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russians to influence the election.</p>
<h3><span id="Sexual_misconduct_allegations">Sexual misconduct allegations</span></h3>

<p>Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced, made on a studio bus while preparing to film an episode of <i>Access Hollywood.</i> On the tape, Trump is heard bragging to the show's then-cohost Billy Bush about forcibly kissing and groping women. "I just start kissing them," he says, "I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab them by the pussy." During the recording, Trump also speaks of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he "moved on her very heavily". These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.</p>
<p>Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as "vulgar", "sexist", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign, and caused outrage across the political spectrum, with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race. A number of Trump supporters worldwide also withdrew their support following release of the tape, including many Conservatives in Britain. Subsequently, at least 15 women came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.</p>
<p>Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconducting accusations, which Trump has called "false smears", and alleged a conspiracy against him. In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had "abused women" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.</p>
<h3><span id="Election_to_the_presidency">Election to the presidency</span></h3>


<p>On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump's election to the presidency. In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.</p>
<p>Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president after losing the popular vote since records began to be kept in 1824. Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 45.95%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.</p>
<p>Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide and in most battleground states, while Trump's support had been underestimated throughout his campaign. The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters. Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton's "blue wall" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush's presidency from 2003 to 2007.</p>
<p>Trump became the first president without prior governmental or military experience. Of the 44 previous presidents, 39 had held prior elective office; 2 had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and 3 had never held public office but had been commanding generals. He is the first Republican since the 1980s to win the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He lost his home state of New York, becoming only the fourth candidate to win the presidency without his home state. The others were James Polk (Tennessee) in 1844, Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey) in 1916, and Richard Nixon (New York) in 1968.</p>
<h3><span id="Protests">Protests</span></h3>

<p>Trump's victory sparked protests across the United States. Democrats, in alignment with other Trump opponents, took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump's views and denounce his inflammatory statements. They argued that Clinton's popular vote victory meant Trump was not actually the democratically elected president and should be considered illegitimate. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of "professional protesters, incited by the media", and were "unfair", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country. In contrast, after Obama's re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted "We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!"</p>
<p>On the Saturday following Trump's inauguration there were massive demonstrations protesting Trump in the United States and worldwide, with approximately 2,600,000 taking place in Women's Marches worldwide. The most notable of these marches was the Women's March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump. This was more than three times the number of people who were at Trump's inaugural speech, according to crowd scientists at the Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

<h3><span id="Transition">Transition</span></h3>


<p>On November 10, President-elect Trump had his first ever meeting with President Obama to discuss plans for a peaceful transition of power. <i>The New York Times</i> stated that "It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites." The BBC stated that "their antipathy was barely concealed" in "awkward photos" of the meeting.</p>
<h4><span id="White_House_appointments">White House appointments</span></h4>
<p>Trump's transition team was led by Chris Christie until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over. Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as Counselor to the President.</p>
<h4><span id="Cabinet-level_nominations">Cabinet-level nominations</span></h4>

<p>He has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Representative Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services, former campaign rival Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce, retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security, businessman Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor (later withdrawn, replaced by attorney and law school dean Alexander Acosta), CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy, U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior, and Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Despite being nominated promptly during the transition period, many cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. By February 8, 2017, President Trump had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed than any other president except George Washington by the same length of time into his presidency. Part of the lateness was ascribed to the delays in submitting background-check paperwork, part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.</p>
<h4><span id="Pre-inauguration_events">Pre-inauguration events</span></h4>
<p>On November 22, in a video posted at YouTube, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office. The plan included the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the United States from cyber-attack.</p>
<p>On December 7, <i>Time</i> named Trump as its "Person of the Year". In an interview on <i>The Today Show</i>, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the "President of the Divided States of America". He also opposed <i>Time</i><span>'s</span> decision to change its "Man of the Year" title to "Person of the Year" in 1999, describing the action as too "politically correct". On December 13 he was named <i>Financial Times</i> Person of the Year. In December 2016, <i>Forbes</i> ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the US presidential election in favor of Trump, notably by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication. Both Trump, WikiLeaks and Russian officials have denied the allegations.</p>
<p>In January 2017, Trump was briefed on a private intelligence dossier containing "potentially compromising personal and financial information" about his activities in Russia, which he denied. The dossier was also leaked to the press and published. Media evaluation of the dossier ranged from "garbage" to "partially corroborated".</p>
<h3><span id="First_100_days">First 100 days</span></h3>


<p>The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president stood to minimize "the economic burden" of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline construction projects and launched the process to build a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.</p>
<h4><span id="Immigration_order">Immigration order</span></h4>


<p>On January 27, President Trump signed an executive order that suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The following day, thousands of protesters gathered at airports and other locations throughout the United States to protest the signing of the order and detainment of the foreign nationals. Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exempting visitors with a green card. Two Iraqi nationals detained upon arrival filed a complaint. Several federal judges issued rulings that curtailed parts of the immigration order, stopping the federal government from deporting visitors already affected.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2016, Trump issued a revised executive order, that, among other differences with the original order, excluded Iraq, visa-holders, and perminent residents from the temporary suspension and did not differentiate Syrian refugees from refugees from other countries.</p>
<h4><span id="Supreme_Court_nomination">Supreme Court nomination</span></h4>

<p>On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
<h3><span id="Domestic_policy">Domestic policy</span></h3>
<h4><span id="Energy_and_climate">Energy and climate</span></h4>
<p>Trump's energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter. His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.</p>
<p>Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking. He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a "disgrace" and has threatened to cut its budget. Trump has pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries. After winning the presidency, Trump admitted "some connectivity" between human activity and climate variability and said he has an "open mind" towards the Paris agreement.</p>
<h4><span id="Immigration">Immigration</span></h4>


<p>Trump's immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promised Mexico would pay for. He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States, and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates "anchor babies". He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other "security threats".</p>
<p>Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented. Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a "proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies", or countries "compromised by terrorism".</p>
<p>In late January 2017 Trump issued an executive order banning the admission of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order, imposed without warning and effective immediately, caused chaos at many airports. Multiple legal challenges were filed against it, and a federal court blocked its implementation. In early March 2017, Trump issued a revised order into law.</p>
<h4><span id="Social_issues">Social issues</span></h4>

<p>Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life and generally opposes abortion with some exceptions: rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother. He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. He personally supports "traditional marriage" but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a "settled" issue.</p>
<p>Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time. Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana. He favors capital punishment, as well as the use of waterboarding.</p>
<h4><span id="Health_care">Health care</span></h4>
<p>In 1999, Trump told <i>Larry King Live</i> that "I believe in universal healthcare." Trump's 2000 book, <i>The America We Deserve</i>, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model, and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.</p>
<p>However, Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare. In March 2016, Trump's campaign released a platform summary which included a variety of free-market health reforms including provisions to allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states.</p>
<p>Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities. On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.</p>
<h4><span id="Education_2">Education</span></h4>
<p>Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools. He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools, and has called Common Core "a disaster" that must be ended. He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.</p>
<h4><span id="Economy_and_trade">Economy and trade</span></h4>

<p>Trump's campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions, and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large "zero bracket" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated. His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.</p>
<p>Trump identifies as a "free trader", but says that trade must be "reasonably fair". He has often been called a "protectionist", because of his criticism of NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and his proposal to raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States significantly. He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted. However, Trump has been very keen to support a "fair" post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom, which Trump claims would be "good for both sides".</p>
<h3><span id="Foreign_policy">Foreign policy</span></h3>


<p>Trump has been described as non-interventionist and nationalist. Trump repeatedly stated that he supports "America First" foreign policy. He supports increasing United States military defense spending, but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region. He says America should look inward, stop "nation building", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs. As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members, and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.</p>
<p>In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops. In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region, a position he later retracted. Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is "a big fan of Israel". During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.</p>
<p>Trump has considered recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia in the past; however, in the aftermath of Michael T. Flynn's resignation as National Security Adviser, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump expects Russia to "return" Crimea to Ukraine, emphatically stating that "Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine". He added that Trump's appointed ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, "strongly denounced the Russian occupation" of Crimea. Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin. He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.</p>
<h3><span id="Indications_of_2020_presidential_campaign">Indications of 2020 presidential campaign</span></h3>

<p>Trump signaled his intent to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency. This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one. The early timing of the beginning of the campaign was highly unorthodox. Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office. By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7 million.</p>
