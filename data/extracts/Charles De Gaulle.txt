<ul><li><b>From other capitalisation</b>: This is a redirect from a title with another method of capitalisation. It leads to the title in accordance with the Wikipedia naming conventions for capitalisation, or it leads to a title that is associated in some way with the conventional capitalisation of this redirect title. This may help writing, searching and international language issues.
<ul><li>If this redirect is an incorrect capitalisation, then {{R from miscapitalisation}} should be used <i>instead</i>, and pages that use this link should be updated to link <i>directly</i> to the target. Miscapitalisations can be tagged in <i>any namespace</i>.</li>
<li>Use this rcat to tag <i>only</i> mainspace redirects; when other capitalisations are in other namespaces, use {{R from modification}} <i>instead</i>.</li>
